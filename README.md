# Simple Node.js Application Deployment

This repository contains a simple Node.js application and infrastructure-as-code for deployment using GitHub Actions, AWS ECR, and AWS ECS with Terraform.

## Application Details

- **Framework**: Node.js
- **Available APIs**:
  - `GET /`: Responds with a `200` status. Used to determine the health of the container.
  - `GET /index`: Provides a sample HTML page.
- **Port**: The application runs on port `3000`.

## Deployment Details

We utilize GitHub Actions for our CI/CD pipeline. The steps involve:

- Building a Docker image of the Node.js application.
- Pushing the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- Deploying the Docker container to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

Given the simplicity of our application:

- We use only a single service and task definition in ECS.
- Auto-scaling for the task is enabled. Depending on the demand, the number of tasks can scale between `2` and `100`.
- To optimize our costs, we deploy our tasks using Fargate Spot instances, which can lead to cost savings of up to `70%`.

## Infrastructure with Terraform

Using Terraform, we provision the following resources:

1. **GitHub User**: A dedicated user for GitHub Actions to interact with AWS services.
2. **Networking**: Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with other essential networking resources.
3. **ECS**: Configuration for the Elastic Container Service, including task definitions, services, and auto-scaling settings to host our application.
